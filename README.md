Development Conventions
=======================

Ensuring we follow _common defaults_ between team members and the projects they work on is a key part of our process. At it's most basic, it enables team members to _pick up_ where another left off and makes for maintainable, scalable code.

The documents contained within this repository set out the conventions we use at [It's Good Practice](http://www.itsgoodpractice.com) to write, maintain, and deploy code.
